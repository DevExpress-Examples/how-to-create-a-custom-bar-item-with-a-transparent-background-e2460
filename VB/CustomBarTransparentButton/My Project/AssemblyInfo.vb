' How to create a custom bar item with a transparent background

' This sample demonstrates how to create a custom bar item with a transparent
' background. As an ancestor of a custom bar item the BarLargeButtonItem control
' has been chosen. This approach can be used to create items with a custom shape
' by adding images to the LargeGlyph, LargeGlyphHot and LargeGlyphPressed
' properties.
